## Requirements
1. Use HTML5 / CSS
2. Make it mobile & tablet responsive using your best judgement
3. Create an interesting hover effect for the image thumbnails
4. Create a simple custom overlay which displays the full size image on clicking on a image thumbnail - use only vanilla JavaScript, no jQuery or any other external library for it
5. Make the page the smallest possible size - ensure that images, JS and CSS are properly optimized, compressed, minified etc for quick page loads (please also include the non-minified versions in your zip)
6. *Optional bonus task 1:* Use [responsive images](https://jakearchibald.com/2015/anatomy-of-responsive-images/)
